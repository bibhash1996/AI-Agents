4. Choose from: Python, JavaScript, C++, or HTML/CSS

Guidelines for language selection:
- Python: Best for data processing, machine learning, automation, scripting, web backends (with frameworks)
- JavaScript: Best for web applications, interactive UIs, Node.js backends, cross-platform mobile apps
- C++: Best for performance-critical applications, system programming, game development, embedded systems
- HTML/CSS: Best for static websites, web interfaces, and frontend styling (usually with JavaScript)
